# Unity-SelfLearning
This repository is as the name suggests, a "Unity self learning" of mine, learning Unity at my own pace.
## Zenva Balloon Popper
This is my first project learning the basics of unity on Zenva platform, their GUI, scripting and some functionalities. It's a game where you click on a ball(oon) for an amount of time to "pop" it.
