# Unity-SelfLearning
This repository is as the name suggests, a "Unity self learning" of mine, learning Unity at my own pace.
## Zenva Balloon Popper
This is my first project learning the basics of unity on Zenva platform, their GUI, scripting and some functionalities. It's a game where you click on a ball(oon) for an amount of time to "pop" it.
## Obstacle Course
This project is about making a player dodge obstacles and move through the course without getting hit. Looking into Cinemachine camera and some 3D physic basics in Unity.
## Project Boost
This project is about a rocket making it way to the finish and dodging obstacles along the way. I learned about physics based movement, audio, scenemanager, state and particles here.
